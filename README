uWave is a texting, Twitter-enabled microwave. See http://uwaved.com
for demo videos and information on how it works.

Code:
See the uWaveArduino PDE for the uWave code. Be sure to edit the 
web_settings_template.h file for your own settings. To implement your own
server, there are two HTTP GET requests you need to be able to handle
from the Arduino. One is the start time:

GET /arduino/start?time=%d HTTP/1.0

where %d is an integer representing seconds. The other is the finish
notification:

GET /arduino/finish HTTP/1.0

This code was implemented on an Arduino Duemilanove using the arduino-0023
SDK.
